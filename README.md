## 🧱 Project Milestones

### 🗓️ **Milestone 1: Project Initialization & Architecture**
**Duration:** 1 week (2025-10-15 → 2025-10-22)  
**Goal:** Setup the development environment and initial architecture.  

**Tasks (Issues):**
- Initialize Django project.  
- Create virtual environment and `requirements.txt`.  
- Connect MySQL database and setup `.env` file.  
- Implement MVC structure (models, views, urls, templates).  
- Setup GitHub repository + branch strategy (`main`, `dev`).

🎯 **Deliverable:** Project runs locally and ready for core feature development.

---

### 🧩 **Milestone 2: Core Features Development**
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2025-10-23 → 2025-11-06)  
**Goal:** Develop the core functionality of the application.  

**Tasks (Issues):**
- Create main models (`Users`, `Data Entities`).  
- Implement CRUD endpoints.  
- Build views + HTML templates.  
- Link ORM models and logic.  
- Write basic test cases.  

🎯 **Deliverable:** Fully functional backend with ORM and CRUD APIs.

---

### 🔒 **Milestone 3: Web Security & Validation**
**Duration:** 1 week (2025-11-07 → 2025-11-14)  
**Goal:** Apply best security and validation practices.  

**Tasks (Issues):**
- Enable CSRF protection.  
- Setup authentication and authorization.  
- Secure database connections.  
- Add input validation & sanitization.  
- Update Django security settings (`ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `SECRET_KEY`, `HTTPS`).  

🎯 **Deliverable:** Secure and production-ready backend system.

---

### 🚀 **Milestone 4: Testing, Optimization & Deployment**
**Duration:** 2 weeks (2025-11-15 → 2025-11-29)  
**Goal:** Test, optimize, and deploy the application.  

**Tasks (Issues):**
- Write full unit and integration tests.  
- Optimize queries and performance.  
- Create Dockerfile + docker-compose setup.  
- Configure Nginx / Gunicorn.  
- Deploy to cloud (GCP / DigitalOcean).  
- Update documentation and final README.  

🎯 **Deliverable:** Production-ready, optimized, and fully documented deployment.

## ⚙️ Local Setup

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>

# 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4️⃣ Setup environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# then fill DB credentials, SECRET_KEY, etc.

# 5️⃣ Run migrations and start server
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## 🧪 Run with Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

✅ This automatically builds the app and connects it to the database container.

---

## 🧾 Issue Templates (Gherkin Format)

Each issue should follow **BDD (Behavior Driven Development)** using the **Gherkin** style:  

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to register and log in
  So that I can access private data

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given a registered user exists
    When they enter valid credentials
    Then they should be redirected to the dashboard
```

Use this template for:
- Features
- Bugs
- Enhancements

---

## 🗂️ GitHub Project Board Structure

**Columns:**
- 📝 To Do
- 🏗️ In Progress
- ✅ Review
- 🚀 Done

Each issue should be linked to its **Milestone** and **assigned** to a team member if applicable.

## 🧭 Branching Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `main` | Stable production code |
| `dev` | Development & testing |
| `feature/*` | Individual features |
| `fix/*` | Bug fixes |
| `release/*` | Pre-release testing |

---

## 📚 Documentation

All environment variables and configurations should be defined in `.env.example`.  
Additional project documentation can be added in `/docs` folder (e.g., `deployment_guide.md`, `api_reference.md`).
