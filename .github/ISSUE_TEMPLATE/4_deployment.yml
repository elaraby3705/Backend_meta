        **Scenario (Gherkin Format):**
        ```gherkin
        Feature: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
          As a DevOps engineer
          I want to test and deploy the app in containers
          So that it runs efficiently and reliably in production

          Scenario: Deploy with Docker and Nginx
            Given I have a Dockerfile and docker-compose setup
            When I build and deploy to the cloud server
            Then the application should be accessible and functional in production
        ```
